/**
 * Convenience class for creating an empty workflow. Useful when a user wants to remove workflow behavior from Broadleaf.
 * For instance, a user might want to subclass {@link OrderService} and provide their own implementation of addItem, but
 * wants to invoke the super implementation of this method to obtain all functionality <i>except</i> executing the workflow
 * since they want to take charge of the entire process themselves.
